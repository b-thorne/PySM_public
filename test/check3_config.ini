[ThermalDust]
#Nominal model is dust1, a single-component modified black body with 
#spatially varying emissivity using Planck-2015 estimates. Dust2 is as
# dust1, but with emissivity that varies as 1.59\pm0.2 on degree-scales.
# dust3 is as dust 2 with emissivity that varies as 1.59\pm0.3.
# dust 4 is a two-component model which uses the model of Finkbeiner et
# al 1999 refitted to the Planck 2015 data.
model = dust1

[Synchrotron]
#Nominal model is synchrotron1, a power-law with a spatially varying spectral index. 
#synchrotron2 has index that steepens off plane from -3 at the equator to -3.3 at the
#poles.
#synchrotron3 uses a power law with cruvature. We add a term: beta_c ln(nu/nu_c), to the
#spectral index. We use values for beta_c and nu_c from Kogut 2012.
model = synchrotron1

[CMB]
#Nominal model cmb1 reads in a CMB map that has been calculated using Taylens 
#(Naess & Louis, astro-ph/1307.0719). You can also provide Cls and compute
# a new lensed CMB realisation.

[SpinningDust]
#Nominal model is spdust1, uses the best-fitting Planck-2015 Commander map in intensity, unpolarized
#Model spdust2 has 2% polarization and uses the thermal dust polarization angles. 
model = spdust1

[FreeFree]
#Nominal model is the Planck 2015 Commander template scaled with 
#the two parameter scaling law presented in Draine, B. T. 2011, Physics 
#of the Interstellar and Intergalactic Medium.
